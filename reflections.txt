You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

New Skills
  * None so far but it will be a good review. I'm looking forward to the canvas element during the game project as that will be new.
Easy
  * Everything. I have been a web developer for many years.
Difficult
  * The most difficult part so far has just been deciding on my personal setup.
Problem Solving
  * I have used web search some to review Markdown syntax and find the strikethrough HTML tag.
